                Say hello to the perfection of Cybele- tall, gorgeous,
                millionaire.
              </p>
              <p>
                Princess Talia was the only successor to the throne, and her
                absence baffled the kingdom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Watch Cybele, both our hero and villain for the story as she
                struggles to fulfill her wishes while trying to keep her
                feelings for the Princess in check.

              <p>
                I watched in fascination as the princess struggled against the
                ropes binding her ankles and wrist.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Unhand me buffoon and I'll tell my mother the queen to spare
                your life," she said indignantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oooh! How lovely. As if her mother the queen could help her
                right now.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I doubt your highness will spare my life if I let you go," I
                said to her.
              </p>
              <p>
                "What do you want from me? Do you want money? Power? Men? I can
                give you all of that."
              </p>
              <p>"Then what do you want?" she asked in a small voice.</p>

              <p>
                She froze in an instant and squirmed away from me. "You're a
                lunatic! Jerk!
              </p>
              <p>
                Her gray eyes took in my features. She licked her thin lips
                nervously and asked, "What color are your eyes. They are the
                strangest green."
              </p>
              <p>
                I smirked at her. "They're called forest green princess." Before
                she could ask another question, I took her in my arms and hauled
                her to the bedroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once we were inside the bedroom, which would be her holding room
                or her cell if you want to call it that, I set her down on the
                bed where she squirmed some more.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I am not!" she said heatedly. I clicked my tongue at her. "Sure
                you're not princess."
              </p>
              <p>
                She stared daggers at me. "Why did you kidnap me? You're a low
                life! You're the lowest!" she seethed.
              </p>
              <p>"Are you going to kill me?" she choked. </p>
              <p>
                "If I wanted to, I would have done it a long time ago. So to
                answer your question, no I'm not going to kill you.
              </p>
              <p>
                I pointed to the windows. "Those are barred. Even if you cut
                that lovely honey colored hair of yours to make a Rapunzel-like
                rope, you'll never escape from here."

            <div class="story">
              <p>
                "Scream all you want," I continued. "This hideout is located
                miles from any town or road. No one will ever hear you.
              </p>
              <p>"I despise you," she said savagely. </p>
              <p>"Well I'm very sorry to hear that," I said with a shrug.</p>
              <p>
                "Wait!" she called out. "Aren't you going to remove my
                restraints?"{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Her question made me smile to myself. "Say please," I said. Her
                jaw clenched. "Are you freaking kidding me?" she said loudly.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                "I don't think her highness would appreciate your smart mouth
                princess." I faced her and grinned widely.
              </p>
              <p>
                I walked back to her and leaned down so I could untie the ropes.
                "See? I know there's some manners left in you," I teased.
              </p>
              <p>
                My hands deftly removed the knots on the rope. Once she was
                untied, the princess moved her hands around and sat on the edge
                of the bed.
              </p>
              <p>
                "You shouldn't have done that," I told her. "My stomach is going
                to bruise.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I'm warning you princess. If you do that again, I'll rip your
                clothes off and let you stay here completely naked."
